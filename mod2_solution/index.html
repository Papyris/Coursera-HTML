	<h1>Menu for First Timers using HTML</h1>


	<div id="Title1" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
		<p class="section">Sublime Text</p>
			<p>Sublime Text is a useful tool allowing users to write HTML code so that the content written can be displayed across a number of browsers. Where possible, users can check the compatibility using <link href="www.caniuse.com">CaniUse.com</link> in order to check the compatibility.

	</div>

	<div id="Title2" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
		<p class="section">GIT</p>
			<p> Having never previously used GIT or GITHUb, it has been great to learn the ability of utilising the terminal command line and then being able to transfer files from and to github directly. This has saved a lot of time and will ensure updates can be fed across seamlessly.  </p>
	</div>

		<p class="section">Module 2</p>
			<P> This assignment is my first in using HTML and CSS, however being able to develop this as a skill is something that I am keen on developing. All this wording may change once i decide how the Menu will need to look. But hey, if you're still reading this, i applaud you as I was just seeing how long I could keep your attention for. Thanks for reading. </P>
